# Gesture Surface Input

A real-time virtual keyboard and mouse using only a webcam and hand gestures. The primary idea is to implement and use keyboards and mouses just with visuals, and focus on reducing input delay.

## Features
- Calibrate any flat surface as an input zone
- Control mouse with cupped hand + finger taps
- Tap physical surface to trigger keyboard input
- Works with top-down webcam input (no overlays)

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
